Hi,

This is readme file for this code. This folder consist three files aapart from readme files. 

Please go through the file and its details below: 

1. Client.py: Python file to send request to server and receive response from it. It is using config.json as input file to send the request. 
2. config.json: This file consist list of all commands in json format and it consist total 16 commands ranging from directory creation to pinging over an active website. 
3. Server.py: This file is processing all the requests that are coming to the server. This uses libraris such as subprocess and json to handle and process the requests.
